I have done this project half because of i have to went to my college city so i can't do further
Module I have created that :
=> Login and SignUp system with localstorage
=>create a home page.
=> In home page it dynamically changes , if user have not signup so he can't access features .
=> In home page user get a select menu with different programming languages.
=> I have set apiCall that way that if user changes the programming language , accordingly the api show the data .
=> After click into view button user redirect to singleJob page , i have set that.
=> Into singleJob page , URL has the details of which programming language he/she choosen with it's ID .
=> The api have not any kind of ID selection category to url . The api is **Adzuna jobs api** .
